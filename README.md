This project aims to implement and evaluate Reinforcement Learning techniques used to enable an autonomous agent to intelligently play Atari games and critically learn from its experience improving its ability to play. Utilising previous work in the field, this project aims to create an initial Agent which intelligently learns to play Atari games
